    condition-readout pairs. If readouts are not guaranteed to be present in all conditions, this should be set
    to a less stringent value than the cutoff for readout correlation to ensure sufficient data points for correlation.

        network diagrams based on correlation profiles. This parameter determines which pairs will be output, i.e. if a
        pair of readouts has a correlation value above or equal to the default value of 0.7, it will be classified as an
        &quot;interaction&quot; pair and will be found in this file, and hence will have a connecting edge in Cytoscape.

        By default all abundance information is used when calculating the correlation between
        readouts X and Y. However, there are cases when it may be appropriate to ignore certain conditions when those
        conditions may have skewed abundance values for either of the readouts being compared. For example, if X and
        Y are genes and they were also used as baits in protein-protein interaction analysis, any detected abundance
        values for the bait gene could be distorted by overexpression artifacts. Ignoring these abundance values may
        prevent the correlation from being skewed by these artifacts. Enabling this option will cause any
        &quot;target&quot; conditions with names matching the &quot;source&quot; readouts in question to be ignored
        during the relevant readout correlation calculations. The name of the condition and readout have to
        match for this to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same rules will also be applied when performing correlation between conditions. However,
        the &quot;source&quot; is now the condition and the &quot;target&quot; is the readout.
