  clusteringOptimize: `The leaf order of clusters can be optimized by selecting this option.
    For large datasets (approximately 1000 conditions or readouts), this can significantly slow
    done the analysis.`,
  control: `The average value of a readout across control samples will be subtracted
    from the detected value for the condition if this is selected. The quantitative value
    for the readout becomes the value above and beyond what is seen across the control
    samples. Specify the column to use for controls in the adjacent "Control column"
    field. If you are applying multiple transformations to your data, control subtraction
    will always occur first (before readout length normalization, condition normalization
    and log transformation).`,
  logBase: `Log-transform abundance values by base 2, e or base 10. If you are applying multiple
    transformations to your data, log transformation will always occur last (after control subtraction,
    readout length normalization and condition normalization).`,
  minConditions: `A readout must pass filtering criteria for at least one condition to be
    included in the analysis. You can increase this value to apply additional stringency
    requiring the readout to satisfy filtering criteria in more than one condition to be
    included in the analysis.`,
  normalization: `No normalization is applied by default but data can be normalized by the total
    abundance between conditions or by a specific readout. If you are applying multiple
    transformations to your data, normalization will always occur after control subtraction
    and readout length normalization but before log transformation.`,
  normalizationReadout: `The readout to use for normalization. Enter the readout name exactly
    as is it appears in the input file as this option is case sensitive.`,
  parsimoniousReadoutFiltering: `All readouts that satisfy the filters for at least one
    condition will be used in the analysis. If a readout satisfies the filters
    for at least one condition, all the quantitative values for this readout â€“ even
    those that did not satisfy the cutoff in particular condition-readout pairs -
    will also be included unless parsimonious readout filtering is enabled. When this
    option is enabled, only quantitative values that explicility pass the filters will be used.`,
  png: `SVG images will always be generated but images in PNG format can also be created if
    this option is selected.`,
  readoutLength: (
    <div>
      The abundance value of each readout can be adjusted to its length (gene/protein length)
      if a column with length is available in the input file. This option should be selected
      if you are worried the length may be unduly affecting the observed abundance. The adjusted
      value of a readout is calculated by dividing the median length of all readouts in the data
      set by the length of readout i and then multiplying by the abundance of readout i.
